				&#8195;&#8195;&#8195;As a computer science major, you are taught to focus solely on detailed oriented, results driven, and by following facts rather than intuition. 
				From my first year in college, I immediately embraced this environment as my way of thinking as I applied it throughout my college career. However, 
				innovation has taught me to put my computer science skills to better use in an innovative atmosphere and style. Being a Bachelor of Innovation student, 
				I was able to enhance my way of problem solving, learning, applying, and leading by the growth I earned as becoming an innovator. 
				<img src="img/inov.jpg" alt="CS" style="width:500px;height:300px;float:right;padding:5px"> 					
				<br>&#8195;&#8195;&#8195;One of the biggest ways that I was able to develop better innovative skills is the process of working with others in a team atmosphere. For my 
				technical classes, I had team projects, but you are grouped with all individuals in STEM fields that share a similar way of working through a task or 
				problem. With that being said, I greatly appreciated my innovation core classes in which I worked in diverse teams with individuals from all backgrounds. 
				This experience in turn taught me to appreciate the different views of people from different fields. From this teamwork, I learned from various projects 
				that the best way to innovate is to combine the different ideas, views, and experiences from people of different backgrounds as the only way to truly 
				achieve an innovation outcome.  
				<br>&#8195;&#8195;&#8195;Secondly, through my journey of becoming an innovator, I have learned to personally voice my thoughts, opinions, and knowledge when working in a 
				group atmosphere. As a computer science student, you can be quiet and still be successful, however, to be an innovator you must use your voice. Being 
				placed in a leadership role, I found that the only way to “get on the court” and be part of innovation is to speak my mind confidently to share my 
				contributions. I can now say that I apply this tactic throughout all my group work whether I am in a leadership position or not to help contribute to 
				a great outcome. With that being said, I also encourage others group members to share their ideas by creating an open atmosphere where no idea or 
				question is considered “stupid”. This conversational environment fosters the growth of innovative concepts as people are freely contributing and working 
				together.   
				<br>&#8195;&#8195;&#8195;Additionally, my innovation growth expanded as I was able to diversify my learning through a cross core disciplinary of Business. By adding core 
				Business knowledge to a Computer Science background, I was able to appreciate non-technical learning as well as apply the combination of both areas to 
				further transform my ideas. I feel like with this combinational knowledge, I can be a more rounded individual so I can bring more to the table when 
				continuing a career in Computer Science fields. 
				<br>&#8195;&#8195;&#8195;Lastly, I feel like I developed the most as an innovator by learning that you must “get on the court” to be able to transform ideas into impact. 
				Personally, I feel that I must never sit back and let things happen but rather be an influence and a part of those big ideas that can innovate a company, 
				an idea, or a project. Through working with a diverse team, communicating knowledge with peers, and expanding my learning I became a better innovator.
